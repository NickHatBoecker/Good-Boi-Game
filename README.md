# Good Boi

Created for itch.io's [One Minute Jam](https://itch.io/jam/one-minute-jam).

## The challenge
A minute is a very short time, in the scheme of things. Or is it? 

Behavioural science suggests that most people make up their minds about someone in the first minute of meeting them. 

Is it possible to make a game that leaves a memorable impression within a single minute of gameplay? 

## The game (spoiler alert)

"A mamorable impression" could be a thought, stuck in your head or a specific emotion. We went for "anger" or "frustration" in this game.

Ever wanted to adopt a pet? Then maybe you know all the preparations; the anticipation. Finally you meet your forever friend, give him a name and watch his little tail wagging. And then somebody enters the room, takes him home and you're a forever loser. ü§∑‚Äç
